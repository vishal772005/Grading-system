# Grading-system
📘 Overview

This Python script is a simple command-line grading system that takes a student’s marks as input and outputs their grade based on predefined ranges.

80–89	A
75–79	B+
70–74	B
50–69	C
34–49	D
Below 34	Fail
▶️ Usage

python grading\ system.py


Enter a numeric value when prompted:

Enter marks: 85


The program outputs:

grade = A
